- debug
 - instrument for parsing floats/bigdecimal
  - branch

 - option to allow invalid unicode through
 - unit tests for 32 bit - test_float_parse
  - look at RUBY_PLATFORM maybe?
 - look at env var for OJ_DEBUG when doing ruby extconf.rb
 - add printf for keys spots in parse and dump
 
- invalid character option
 - don't check options
  - replace with best attempt such as \ud83d => \xED\xA0\xBD
  - that would be the normal replacement
 - allow_invalid_unicode

- streaming parser for scp and saj

---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is
10% to 15% of the total so splitting ruby calls and c does not help much and the
overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby calls
into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object
creation.
