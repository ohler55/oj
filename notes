- make test for mimic
 - try define or load module
 - see if it works after loading json

- replace_JSON
 - after json require

- allow maps to be used for classnames when encoding and decoding objects
 - build a string to string map/table that allows lookups in either direction
 - could use exising cache to do the mapping for decode
  - problem if no class_cache

- try hash for cache/str-str mapping

---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is 10% to 15% of the total so splitting
ruby calls and c does not help much and the overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby
calls into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object creation.
