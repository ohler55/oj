- precision of float dump
 - add option with default of 15
  - sprintf into a dbl_fmt[8] "%0.%dg" (need 6 chars plus terminator)
  - limit to 1 to 20 (or 17?)
  - 0 or less indicated use ruby

- #193 make dump for float to fix roundoff errors 

+ mimic_JSON
 - fixes #192, #190

- #183 should be closed 
- #187 should be closed 

- rbx test
 - get latest
- timezone in object time
 - object.c
  - hat_num


- add hash_key to scp
 - update sparse

 - call from sparse and parse
 - scp.c - implement hash_key()
  - call hash_key and set key_val, don't set key


- streaming parser for scp and saj


---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is
10% to 15% of the total so splitting ruby calls and c does not help much and the
overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby calls
into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object
creation.
