- struct
 - test as_jsonwith rails
 - handle no name structs
  - how to capture the element names?
   - is a object needed instead of an array?
   - maybe if no name then use array of names as the name

- streaming parser for scp and saj


---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is
10% to 15% of the total so splitting ruby calls and c does not help much and the
overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby calls
into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object
creation.
