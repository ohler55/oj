- odd
 - register module
  - immediate children use odd func


- streaming parser for scp and saj

- use these instead of num2long
 LONG_LONG rb_num2ll _((VALUE));
 unsigned LONG_LONG rb_num2ull _((VALUE));


---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is
10% to 15% of the total so splitting ruby calls and c does not help much and the
overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby calls
into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object
creation.
