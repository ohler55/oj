---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is 10% to 15% of the total so splitting
ruby calls and c does not help much and the overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby
calls into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object creation.
