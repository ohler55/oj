Strict Dump Performance
JSON::Ext.dump 20000 times in 0.173 seconds or 115493.546 dump/sec.
Oj:strict.dump 20000 times in 0.050 seconds or 401475.753 dump/sec.

- refactor
 - what happened to obj mode loading time?

 - can __method__ be checked for to_json?
  - tests with to_json calling Oj.dump on itself
  - VALUE rb_current_receiver(void);
  - int rb_frame_method_id_and_class(ID *idp, VALUE *klassp);

 - plan
  - oj.c

   - mimic calls
    - review and fix if needed
    - maybe don't use a different default set since they are ignored anyway
   - used compat mode
   - check top level for to_json otherwise not
   - normal dump does not
    - check infinity handling, different for each mode
  - reorg tests
   - test_<mode>
   - isolated rails stuff
    - only need to verify JSON methods have beed defined and not overridden
    - really a mimic tests
    - can rails tests not be run for 1.9.3?

  - compat
   - option for circular
   - handle options
    - unit tests

  - add to_hash option
  - create dump_custom, copy from compat
  - modify compat to not use :use_xx_json
  - have rails use compat funcs
  
 - add rails mode
 - add use_to_hash option
 - custom mode for using all the options

 - hook up circular for strict and compat but without adding the id
 
  

- rail compat
 - fix struct
 - consider
  - detecting active classes (how expensive is it) and calling as_json
  - something like odd but with a faster lookup that has specially build active dumpers

 + Regexp
 + StringSpecial
  - new friendly mode for XSS and hibit - hixss
 + Struct
 + Rational
 + Enumerable

 - add circular check for compat and just stop on compat and don't follow

 - Process::Status
 - ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone
 - ActiveModel::Errors
 - ActiveSupport::Multibyte::Chars
 - ActiveRecord::Relation

 - make regexp an odd

 - how about a const for rails options (separate from mimic or maybe the same set)
  - or a function to set options to rails

- debug
 - instrument for parsing floats/bigdecimal
  - branch

 - option to allow invalid unicode through
 - unit tests for 32 bit - test_float_parse
  - look at RUBY_PLATFORM maybe?
 - look at env var for OJ_DEBUG when doing ruby extconf.rb
 - add printf for keys spots in parse and dump
 
- invalid character option
 - don't check options
  - replace with best attempt such as \ud83d => \xED\xA0\xBD
  - that would be the normal replacement
 - allow_invalid_unicode

- streaming parser for scp and saj

---------------------------
Tried a separate thread for the parser and the results were poor. The parsing is
10% to 15% of the total so splitting ruby calls and c does not help much and the
overhead of swapping data was too high. It was not possible to split ruby calls
into both threads due to not getting a lock on the ruby environment for object
creation.
