- next
 - update performance tests on README
 - release 0.9.0
 - remove circular branch

 - stream
  - load
   - callback parser
    - object_start
    - object_end
    - array_start
    - array_end
    - value - just primitive or one for each type
    - key

   - default callbacks use straight C and create Hash or Object according to mode
    - callback object
    - check respond_to? for each method at start
    - methods to indicate that defaults should be used instead of ignored
     - use_default_hash_callback?
     - use_default_array_callback?
     - use_default_key_callback?
     - use_default_value_callback?
    - or maybe
     - hash_callback? returns nil, :default, :my_hash_callback
      - default is to check hash_start and hash_end and no nothing if they do not exist
      - 

  - dump
   - support stream as arg
   - always dump to stream/file if possible (check performance)

- dump
 - multibyte group encoding
 - object and other types of object dumping


- fast

- get_leaf
 - start at top and follow where_path to where, then start get
  - need current position and last position (leaf)
  - loc is 0 till found then it becomes 1
  - return indicator of moving back up from child call
   - negate loc?

 - perf on where? and value_at
  - value_at -> fetch
   - compare to x.fetch('abc', {}).fetch()
    - pick correct lookup
  - [path] fetch(path, nil)

 - example
  - contacts
   - pull apart input file with multiple contacts and write individual files
   - phone book get only name and phone

 - implement dump, useful for debug

 - build C structs for parts
  - linked lists (maybe hash later)
  - types
   - hash linked list of others
   - array
   - key_value
   - value (all basic types)
 - keep one top node work walking tree
 - parse by walking and getting all as strings except keep track of types
  - as asked for, convert, create ruby obj, cache, return
  - need some way to tell when memory can be released
   - ALLOC_N, xfree, Data_Wrap_Struct
 
 
    # String paths are used to identify one or more elements of a JSON. The
    # paths used are similar to XPath but simple JSONPaths can also be used as
    # long as they start with an @ or a $. The Fast native path format will be
    # more efficient in this class.
