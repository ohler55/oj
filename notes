- next
 - symbolize keys option
 - io object as option for input

 - stream
  - load
   - callback parser
    - object_start
    - object_end
    - array_start
    - array_end
    - value - just primitive or one for each type
    - key

   - default callbacks use straight C and create Hash or Object according to mode
    - callback object
    - check respond_to? for each method at start
    - methods to indicate that defaults should be used instead of ignored
     - use_default_hash_callback?
     - use_default_array_callback?
     - use_default_key_callback?
     - use_default_value_callback?
    - or maybe
     - hash_callback? returns nil, :default, :my_hash_callback
      - default is to check hash_start and hash_end and no nothing if they do not exist

  - dump
   - support stream as arg
   - always dump to stream/file if possible (check performance)

- dump
 - multibyte group encoding
 - object and other types of object dumping


- fast

 - dump native
