# This is a hack to work around an oddness with DateTime and the ActiveSupport
# that causes a hang when some methods are called from C. Hour, min(ute),
# sec(ond) and other methods are special but they can be called from C until
# activesupport/time is required. After that they can not be even though
# resond_to? returns true. By defining methods to call super the problem goes
# away. There is obviously some magic going on under the covers that I don't
# understand.
