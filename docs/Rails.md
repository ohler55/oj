# Oj Rails Compatibility

The `:rails` mode mimics the ActiveSupport version 5 encoder. Rails and
ActiveSupport are built around the use of the `as_json(*)` method defined for
a class. Oj attempts to provide the same functionality by being a drop in
replacement with a few exceptions.

```ruby
require 'oj'

Oj::Rails.set_encoder()
Oj::Rails.set_decoder()
Oj::Rails.optimize(Array, BigDecimal, Hash, Range, Regexp, Time)
```

Some of the Oj options are supported as arguments to the encoder if called
from Oj::Rails.encode() but when using the Oj::Rails::Encoder class the
encode() method does not support optional arguments as required by the
ActiveSupport compliance guidelines. The general approach Rails takes for
configuring encoding options is to either set global values or to create a new
instance of the Encoder class and provide options in the initializer.

The globals that ActiveSupport uses for encoding are:

 * ActiveSupport::JSON::Encoding.use_standard_json_time_format
 * ActiveSupport::JSON::Encoding.escape_html_entities_in_json
 * ActiveSupport::JSON::Encoding.time_precision
 * ActiveSupport::JSON::Encoding.json_encoder

Those globals are aliased to also be accessed from the ActiveSupport module
directly so ActiveSupport::JSON::Encoding.time_precision can also be accessed
from ActiveSupport.time_precision. Oj makes use of these globals in mimicing
Rails after the Oj::Rails.set_encode() method is called. That also sets the
ActiveSupport.json_encoder to the Oj::Rails::Encoder class.

Options passed into a call to to_json() are passed to the as_json()
methods. These are mostly ignored by Oj and simply passed on without
modifications as per the guidelines. The exception to this are the options
specific to Oj such as the :circular option which it used to detect circular
references while encoding.

By default Oj acts like the ActiveSupport encoder and honors any changes in
the as_json() methods. There are also optimized encoders for some
classes. When the optimized encoder it toggled the as_json() methods will not
be called for that class but instead the optimized version will be called. The
optimized version is the same as the ActiveSupport default encoding for a
given class. The optimized versions are toggled with the optimize() and
deoptimize() methods.

The classes that can be put in optimized mode are:

 * Array
 * BigDecimal
 * Hash
 * Range
 * Regexp
 * Time

The ActiveSupport decoder is the JSON.parse() method. Calling the
Oj::Rails.set_decoder() method replaces that method with the Oj equivelant.
